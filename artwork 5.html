	Description:    
	In this piece, I wanted to explore how the new age of technology affects our society and minds. The devices that we use on the daily, most commonly smartphones, has given us access to unlimited knowledge. The world is easily accessible, information can be discovered in an instant. Having immediate access to information has become overwhelming to the public. With the continuous use of these devices, people are constantly bombarded with different types of information. This constant bombardment of information creates a sensory overload for users. As a result, our current society has become overwhelmed by our current media and technology.

	Sculpture:
 	I created a sculpture to help express these ideas of overstimulation. I also thought it would be intresting to combine video art with 3D sculpture, combining a medium that I have more experience and with a newer medium. I do wish a had more time to work on the sculputre and make it a larger scale.</p>
