	Title: How We Use Video in Our Modern Culture
	Date: September 16, 2019
	Mediums: HD color video, 0"4"48
	Description: 
    I explore how we used video in our everyday lives, by recording clips of how my own family uses video in our household. I chose to focus on the content of the videos that were being viewed as if the video was being viewed in the same position as my family members were viewing their content. During the film, I also added commentary to reflect on how we use and consume video in our everyday lives.Since film and videos are new mediums that I am working with, I focused on practicing with different editing styles and filming methods.
