				<h2>Welcome!</h2>
				<p>In my work I try to give insight to the human psyche in a world with an increased consumption of technology and mass media. These artworks have helped me develop a deeper understanding of the virtual world that lives within
					technology. This understanding helps create a bridge between the virtual world and the physical world. How a person’s thoughts can transform in these different worlds and how the same topic interacts differently in these two worlds. We can
					use technology to provide information, but we also can use technology to transform and challenge what we know. Each user of technology is a person with complex experiences that can be shared both in the real and virtual worlds.</p>

				<p>As I have grown as an artist, I wish to explore further in my artwork how mass media, technology, the internet, etc…, affect the human psyche. As an artist, I try to focus on expressing my own experiences in an extensive and complex
					society . In my work, I wish to explore both the negative and positive ways our collective communities impact each member. That’s why I chose to work with the digital medium; Technology is more prevalent in the world than ever before so it
					is important to understand how we interact with it. The best way to express our relationship with technology is with the medium itself. We can use technology as a provider of information but, also a way to express ideas, concepts, and
					emotions artistically. People all around the world can communicate in an instant with the use of technologies such as the internet or phones. We can relate to each other in ways that were not easily accessible before. Sharing each person's
					unique experiences to a world filled with different complex individuals.
