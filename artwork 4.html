	<h4>Interractive Website</h4>
	<p>
	Title: Fake News
	<br></br>
	Date: October 28,2019
	<br></br>
	Dimension: N/A

	Description:
	My website is inspired by Jenny Holzer's, Redacted Pieces (2008), and our current New Media situation of "Fake News". In the website also investigates the question of "What is Real News"?
	The website is designed to look like a newspaper, more specifically The New York Times. I created a small video called redacted clips with news clips and added a censor bar to add a feeling of redaction. There are black boxes you can highlight to discover the redacted text/information.
