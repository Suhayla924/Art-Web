				<h2>Bio</h2>
			<p>Suhayla Hassan was born and raised in the California Bay Area. Suhayla’s primary focus of work is to give insight into the human psyche in a world with increased consumption of technology and mass media using digital mediums and her own experiences. She conceptually focuses on the relationship shared between the real world and the virtual world. Utilizing technology to creatively rethinking older ideas and concepts of previous artists and scholars through a new lens. Recent projects by Suhayla approach the dependency of technology and its disruption to people’s functionality and how people view themselves. Resulting in disrupted identities, anxieties, altered memory, and sense of reality.
