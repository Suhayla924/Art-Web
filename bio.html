	<h4>Bio</h4>
	<p>	As an artist, I try to focus on how function as individuals in society. In my work, I wish to explore both the negative and positive ways our communities impact ourselves. Another goal of mine as an artist is to illustrate the emotions and feelings that people have a hard time expressing in their lives.
		<br></br>
    The subjects I explore in my works tend to be focused on mass media, technology, the internet, etc, and explore how it affects the human psyche. Having grown up in the age of a technological boom, it's interesting to see how much technology has changed how people function and feel around the world.
    <br></br>
    I enjoy mixing traditional mediums for example wood, metal, sculpture with modern mediums such as video, websites and sound design. Working with both mediums helps connect my artwork by investigating the relationship between the real world and the virtual world.
